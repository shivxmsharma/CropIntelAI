# 🌱 CropIntelAI

**AI-powered crop and fertilizer recommendation system for sustainable agriculture**

CropIntelAI is a machine learning-based decision support system that leverages soil parameters, historical crop data, and real-time weather information to recommend the most suitable crops and fertilizers for a given agricultural plot. Designed with sustainability and efficiency in mind, this tool helps farmers and agronomists make data-driven decisions that enhance yield, reduce input costs, and promote eco-friendly practices.
